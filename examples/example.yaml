# This is an example config of the if_mib module.

# Ports in this config have aliases (ifAlias) that give them their logical names. If you don't use
# aliases, names of the ports would be `lan1`, `eth0` or similar, not `Bullet` etc.

# The aliases are mangled by the code so that they are valid ROS graph resource names - i.e.
# matching regex ^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*$. To perform this mangling, iconv //TRANSLIT feature is used
# to find the "closest" ASCII character to all non-ASCII ones, and then all non-alphanumeric
# characters are replaced by underscores (e.g. spaces), and multiple underscores are coalesced into
# a single one. If the mangled alias is still not a valid name (e.g. it starts with a number),
# ifName or ifDescr are tried next (they also undergo this name mangling).
